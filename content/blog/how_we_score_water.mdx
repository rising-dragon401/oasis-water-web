## Overview

We all need water, but not all water is the same. Whether it's bottled, straight from the tap, or filtered, understanding the cleanliness and health of water is vital for taking care of our health and supporting longevity.
Every water has it's own unique characteristics and we've created a scoring system to help you understand the quality of the water you drink.

Please note our scoring system is subject to change in light of new scientific evidence and research. We choose to open-source our scoring system to allow for transparency and to encourage feedback and improvement.

## How we score bottled water

Everything is scored out of 100 and we penalize each item depending on a few factors.

Factors we consider:

- Source
- Contaminant amount and levels
- Packaging/material
- Filtration method

### Source

The source of water is the first thing we consider when scoring water. Not all water is the same and it starts with the source. A large portion of bottled water comes straight from municipal water supplies and undergoes intense treatement to remove the countless toxins inside. This treatment strips water of it's natural minerals making it harder for the body to digest and often adds disenfenctant by-products to the water.

Other source of water include natural springs, aquifers, icebergs, deep wells, and other natural sources. Ideally the water doesn't need to be filtered much and comes from a natural source which includes healthy minerals.

Penalties

- Municipal water supply: 30
- Mountain spring: +10 (bonus)
- Unknown (not stated in report): 5
- Well: 0

### Contaminant amount and levels

It's hard to find water on Earth anymore without some level of contamination, however we set a high standard and believe water can only be 100/100 if it has no harmful contmainants.

We penalize water for the number of unique contaminants and the levels of each substance (based on the legal limit or health guideline).

Penalties:

- Unique contaminants: 5 per contaminant (max 40)
- Amount over guideline: level above \* 2.5 (max 40)

### Packaging/material

More and more studies are showing the dangers of plastic and the microplastics that leach into the water. We penalize water bottles made of plastic.

Penalties:

- Plastic: 20

### Filtration method

There are several ways to filter water and some filtering techniques can strip water of it's natural minerals which provide our body with essential nutrients. Often a more agressive filtration method such as distillation is a reflection of how dirty the source water is.

Penalties:

- Distillation: 10
