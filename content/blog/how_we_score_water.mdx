## Overview

We all need water, we all drink it but not all water is the same. Whether it's bottled, straight from the tap, or filtered to perfection, understanding the cleanliness and health of water is vital for our taking care of our health and well-being.
Each water source has it's own unique characteristics and we've created a rating system to help you understand the quality of the water you drink.

Factors we consider

- Source
- Packaging/material and microplastics
- Contaminant levels
- Filtration method

# Source of Water

Not all water is the same and it starts with the source. A large portion of bottled water comes straight from municipal water supplies. This means that the water you're drinking from a bottle is the same water that comes out of your tap. The only difference is that it's been filtered and packaged.

Water is also sourced from natural springs, aquifers, icebergs, deep wells, and other natural sources. These sources are often cleaner and more natural than municipal water supplies.

We downgrade water which comes from municipal water supplies and award a higher rating to water which comes from natural sources like mountain springs.

# Contaminant Levels

Contaminants can be very harmful to our longevity and are surprisingly common in many water options. Substances such as Uranium, Arsenic, and Lead are often found in water sources.

We penalize water which as more contaminants while also comparing the levels of each substance against health guidelines and legal limits..

# Filtration method

Some filtering techniques can strip water of it's natural minerals which provide our body with essential nutrients.

We award a higher value to water that includes natural minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium without needing to add artificial ingredients.

Again the key is the source. Ideally water doesn't need to be filtered much and comes from a natural source which includes healthy minerals.

# Packaging and Microplastics

Plastic is a huge problem for our planet and our health. Plastic bottles are typically made with PET plastic which can leach microplastics into the water.

A recent study found that 1L of bottled water in a plastic water bottle can contain as many as 240,000 microplastics which are small enough to be absorbed by our blood-brain barrier.

# Conclusion

Our scoring system is constantly evolving based on the latest research and data. We are committed to providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date information on the water you drink.
