## Overview

We all need it, but not all of is good for us. Whether it's bottled, straight from the tap, or filtered to perfection, understanding the cleanliness and health of water is vital for our health and well-being.

When rating the water on Oaisys, we look at the following:

- Source of water
- Contaminant levels
- Inclusion of natural minerals

# Source of Water

Every drop has a story, and the source of water is where it all startes. For bottled water, this could be an alpine spring, a deep well, or even a public water supply. Tap water, on the other hand, is often sourced from rivers, reservoirs, or groundwater.

We award a higher value to water that is sourced from natural, uncontaminated sources like mountain springs and squifiers. Sources like municipal water supplies are downgraded.

# Contaminant Levels

Contaminants can be very harmful to our longevity and are surprisingly common in many water options. Substances such as Uranium, Arsenic, and Lead are often found in water sources.

We penalize water which as more contaminants while also comparing the levels of each substance against health guidelines and legal limits..

# Inclusion of Natural Minerals

Some filtering techniques can strip water of it's natural minerals which provide our body with essential nutrients.

We award a higher value to water that includes natural minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium without needing to add artificial ingredients.

# Conclusion

Our scoring system is constantly evolving based on the latest research and data. We are committed to providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date information on the water you drink.
