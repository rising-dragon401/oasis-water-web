Depending on where you live, tap water sources are often filled with many toxic and harmful chemicals.
These are a list of common ones found throughout the United Steas and their effects on your health. Please note:
this is not a complete list nor does it suggest all of these chemicals are in your water.

**Alachlore**: Associated with increased cancer risk and liver, kidney, spleen, eye, and nose damage.

**Arsenic**: Long-term exposure can lead to skin, bladder, and lung cancers; skin discoloration and lesions.

**Atrazine**: May disrupt endocrine system, linked to birth defects and reproductive disorders.

**Benzenee**: Known carcinogen; can cause bone marrow failure, anemia, and leukemia.

**Cadmium**: Kidney damage and bone demineralization; linked to respiratory and prostate cancer.

**Carbon Tetrachloride**: Liver, kidney, and central nervous system damage; potential carcinogen.

**Chlordanee**: Affects nervous system, digestive system, and liver; potential carcinogen.

**Chlorobenzene**: Can damage liver, kidney, and central nervous system.

**Chloropicrin**: Eye and respiratory irritant; can cause lung damage.

**Copper**: High levels can cause gastrointestinal distress and liver or kidney damage.

**Dibromochloropropane**: Testicular damage and infertility; possible carcinogen.

**p-Dichlorobenzene**: May harm liver and kidneys; possibly carcinogenic.

**1,2-Dichloroethane**: Can cause liver and kidney damage; likely carcinogen.

**1,1-Dichloroethylene**: Potential effects on liver and nervous system; possibly carcinogenic.

**cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene**: May affect liver; data on health effects limited.

**trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene**: Limited data, but potential liver and lung effects.

**1,2-Dichloropropane**: Associated with increased cancer risk.

**Dinoseb**: Can affect thyroid and reproductive system; potential carcinogen.

**Endrin**: Affects nervous system; can cause convulsions and headaches.

**Ethylbenzene**: May cause liver, kidney, and central nervous system damage.

**Ethylene dibromide (EDB)**: Highly toxic; affects the lungs, stomach, and reproductive system.

**Haloacetonitriles (HAN)**: Potential carcinogens; can affect liver and kidneys.

**1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone**: Limited data, but may be carcinogenic.

**Heptachlor epoxide**: Liver damage and increased cancer risk.

**Hexachlorocyclopentadiene**: Irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.

**Mercury**: Affects the nervous system, particularly in fetuses and young children.

**Nitrate**: Can cause "blue baby syndrome" and affect oxygen transport in blood.

**Nitrite**: Similar effects as nitrate; can affect oxygen transport in blood.

**p-Dichlorobenzene**: Potential liver and kidney effects; data limited.

**Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)**: Linked to cancer, liver damage, and developmental effects.

**Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS)**: May affect cholesterol levels, liver, and thyroid.

**Radium**: Increased risk of bone cancer; affects teeth and bones.

**Simazine**: Endocrine disruptor; potential carcinogen.

**Styrene**: Possible effects on the nervous system; may affect hearing and vision.

**Tetrachloroethylene**: Neurological effects, kidney and liver damage; likely carcinogen.

**Toluene**: Affects the nervous system; can cause kidney and liver damage.

**1,1,1-Trichloroethane**: Central nervous system depressant; may affect liver and kidneys.

**Trichloroethylene**: Can cause liver, kidney, and immune system damage; probable carcinogen.

**Trihalomethanes (THMs)**: Linked to bladder and colorectal cancer; may affect liver, kidney, and central nervous system.

**Uranium**: Kidney damage and increased risk of cancer.

**Xylenes**: Affect the central nervous system; can cause liver and kidney damage.

**Chromium**: Long-term exposure can lead to skin conditions, and increased risk of lung and stomach cancers.
