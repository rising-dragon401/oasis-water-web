## Introduction

If you haven't heard, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of compounds that are commonly found in drinking water.
These compounds are known to be harmful to human health and have been linked to various health issues, including cancer, thyroid disease, and immune system disorders.
Unfortunately, PFAS are not only found in drinking water but also in many consumer products, including food packaging, non-stick cookware, and even some cosmetics.
Over the last few years, there has been a growing concern about the presence of PFAS in bottled water, with many consumers wondering which brands are safe to drink.

Here's a most of up to date list of bottled waters that contain PFAS and those that do not. Note most brands do not test for PFAS so some of this data be out of date.
Oasis is working on going through each one and testing them for PFAS in our lab, we will update this list as we get more data.

## Bottled Waters with PFAS

Consumer Reports tested 47 bottled waters and found that 43 of them contained detectable levels of PFAS. [Another study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135421004905?dgcid=rss_sd_all) by led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, detected PFAS substances in 39 out of more than 100 bottled waters tested.
Even more recenlty the EPA announced at least 33% of water systems tested contained PFAS.

Here's what the latest reports say:

## Bottled Waters without PFAS

- Waiakea Hawaiian Volcanic Water
- Good & Gather (Target) Purified Water

[This report](https://dec.vermont.gov/sites/dec/files/documents/VT%20Bottled%20Water%20Non-Detect%20PFAS%20Results_0.pdf) lists many other brands as without PFAS but we have not veried this information.

## Conclusion

The fact is most brands don't test for PFAS and or don't share these reports so it's difficult to know for sure which waters don't contain PFAS without testing each one.

As mentioned this is something we are working on and will update this list as we get more data.
