# The Alarming Reality of Nanoplastics and Forever Chemicals

In recent years, the scientific community has become increasingly concerned about two interrelated environmental threats: nanoplastics and "forever chemicals." These pervasive pollutants are now ubiquitous in our environment, raising serious questions about their long-term impacts on ecosystems and human health. This article delves into the latest research findings, exploring the scope of the problem and its implications for our future.

## Understanding Nanoplastics and Microplastics

Nanoplastics are extremely small plastic particles, typically less than 1 micrometer in size. They are often the result of the breakdown of larger plastic items or are intentionally manufactured at this size. Microplastics, slightly larger, are defined as plastic particles less than 5 mm in size. Both have become prevalent in our environment, with alarming consequences.

## The Scale of the Problem

</div>

### Aquatic Life

**Fish:**

- A study of commercially important fish species in Turkey found that 50-63% of fish had microplastics in their gastrointestinal tracts.
- Rainbow trout contained the highest amount at 1.2 MP particles per fish.
- In Australia, 35.5% of fish samples from seafood markets had at least one piece of microplastic in their gastrointestinal tract.

**Mussels:**

- A study of mussels from five European countries found 3 to 5 microplastic fibers per 10g of mussels.

**Marine Copepods:**

- Exposure to polypropylene from surgical masks led to a significant decrease in fecundity.
- At 100 MPs/mL, average offspring in the first four broods decreased to 19.96 ± 5.86, compared to 25.57 ± 5.04 in the control group.

**Octopus:**

- _Amphioctopus fangsiao_ exposed to microplastics showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered antioxidant enzyme activities.

### Birds

**Storm Petrels:**

- 45% of storm petrels in the Mediterranean Sea had ingested microplastics via their food.

**Barn Owls:**

- 33% of barn owl pellets contained microplastics, mainly macrofibers (88.2%).

**Flesh-footed Shearwaters:**

- Birds that had ingested plastics showed higher inflammatory responses, stomach lining deterioration, and higher tissue damage scores across multiple organs.

**Arctic Glaucous Gulls:**

- Microplastics were found in 14.3% of the birds' intestines, mostly consisting of polypropylene and polystyrene.

### Terrestrial Animals

**Chickens:**

- Exposure to microplastics decreased growth and antioxidant ability, impaired viscera, and significantly decreased alpha diversity in gut microbiota.

**Mice:**

- Airway contamination with microplastics induced respiratory microbial dysbiosis.

**Pigs:**

- Microplastics were found in the lung tissue of both domestic and fetal pigs, with an average of 12 MP particles/g in domestic pig lungs and 6 particles/g in fetal pig lungs.

    alt="Spectrum of current knowledge regarding microplastics"
    className="rounded-lg h-full w-full object-contain object-center"
  />
</div>

The effects of nanoplastics and microplastics on wildlife are deeply concerning:

- **Oxidative Stress:** In zebrafish, exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) led to significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The ROS content more than doubled in exposed fish.
- **Enzyme Activity Disruption:** SOD activity decreased by up to 75% in the gut and 30% in the liver of exposed zebrafish.
- **Reproductive Effects:** Marine copepods exposed to polypropylene showed decreased fecundity.
- **Tissue Damage:** Flesh-footed shearwaters that ingested plastics showed significant tissue-level effects, including higher inflammatory response and stomach lining deterioration.
- **Developmental Issues:** Chicken embryos exposed to polystyrene microplastics showed myocardial dysplasia and altered expression of genes crucial for heart development.
- **Behavioral Changes:** Zebrafish exposed to microplastics showed reduced food intake, with total food intake reduced by 64.3–69.6% in some cases.

## Chemical Interactions: The "Forever Chemicals" Problem

The issue of microplastics is further complicated by their interaction with other pollutants, particularly "forever chemicals" such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

### What Are Forever Chemicals?

Forever chemicals, including PFAS, are a group of man-made chemicals that are extremely persistent in the environment and the human body. They are used in various products for their water and oil-repellent properties.

    alt="Nanoplastics and 'forever chemicals' shown to disrupt molecular structures and functionality"
    className="rounded-lg h-full w-full object-contain object-center"
  />
</div>

### Key Findings on Forever Chemicals:

- **Widespread Presence:** PFAS have been detected in water, soil, air, and even Arctic sea ice.
- **Bioaccumulation:** These chemicals can accumulate in the bodies of humans and animals over time.
- **Health Concerns:** Studies have linked PFAS exposure to various health issues, including cancer, thyroid disease, and immune system problems.
- **Interaction with Microplastics:** Microplastics can adsorb and concentrate PFAS, potentially acting as vectors for these chemicals in the environment.

### Synergistic Effects

The combination of microplastics and forever chemicals may lead to synergistic effects:

- **Enhanced Toxicity:** A study on mussels exposed to microplastics with sorbed crude oil found increased bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), with total PAH values reaching 2306 ± 372.42 ng/g dry weight after 7 days of exposure.
- **Vector for Contaminants:** Microplastics can act as carriers for PFAS and other persistent organic pollutants, potentially increasing their bioavailability to organisms.
- **Complex Mixtures:** The presence of both microplastics and forever chemicals in the environment creates complex mixtures with potentially unpredictable effects on ecosystems and human health.

## Human Health Concerns

    className="rounded-lg h-full w-full object-contain object-center"
  />
</div>

While direct studies on human health are limited, there's growing evidence of human exposure to both microplastics and forever chemicals:

- **Microplastics in Food and Water:**
  - One study reported 0.44 MPs/g in sugar, 0.11 MPs/g in salt, and 0.09 MPs/g in bottled water.
  - Microplastics were found in human stools, with an average of 20 plastic particles per 10g of stool.
- **PFAS in Blood:** PFAS have been detected in the blood of 97% of Americans tested.
- **Potential Health Effects:** While research is ongoing, concerns include potential impacts on the immune system, hormone function, and organ development.
- **Occupational Exposure:** Workers in certain industries may be at higher risk of exposure to both microplastics and forever chemicals.

## Analytical Challenges and Advances

Detecting and characterizing nanoplastics and forever chemicals presents significant analytical challenges:

- **Microplastic Analysis:**
  - Researchers use a combination of techniques, including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy.
  - FTIR can detect particles down to 20 μm, while Raman spectroscopy can identify particles as small as 1 μm.
- **Forever Chemical Detection:** Advanced mass spectrometry techniques are used to detect and quantify PFAS in environmental and biological samples.
- **Emerging Technologies:** New methods are being developed to improve the detection and characterization of both microplastics and forever chemicals at lower concentrations.

# Microplastics as Vectors for Heavy Metals and Flame Retardants: A Growing Environmental Concern

The problem of microplastic pollution is further complicated by the ability of these tiny particles to act as vectors for other harmful substances, particularly heavy metals and flame retardants. This interaction creates a complex environmental issue with potential far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human health.

## Heavy Metals and Microplastics

Heavy metals are often used as additives in plastic production to enhance various properties of the final product. Some common uses include:

- **Antimony and aluminum compounds** as flame retardants
- **Zinc, lead, chromium, cobalt, cadmium, and titanium** as colorants
- **Lead and cadmium compounds** as stabilizers

These metals can leach from plastics over time, but more concerningly, microplastics can adsorb additional heavy metals from the environment, potentially concentrating them to levels higher than the surrounding water or sediment.

### Key findings on heavy metal interactions with microplastics include:

- **Adsorption capacity:** Studies have shown that both virgin and aged microplastics can adsorb trace metals (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) from the environment. Aged pellets generally show higher adsorption rates.
- **Mechanism:** Metal adsorption occurs through interactions between metal ions and charged or polar regions on the plastic surface, as well as through non-specific interactions with the hydrophobic plastic surface.
- **Environmental factors:** The interaction between metals and microplastics is influenced by various factors including pH, salinity, photo-oxidative erosion, and the formation of biofilms on the plastic surface.
- **Nanoplastics:** Smaller plastic particles, such as nanoplastics, show even higher adsorption capacities. For example, lead (Pb) adsorption on nanoplastics reached steady-state after about 200 minutes, with maximum sorption capacities between 78.5% and 97%.
- **Vector for bioaccumulation:** Microplastics laden with heavy metals can be ingested by marine organisms, potentially leading to bioaccumulation of these metals in the food web.

## Flame Retardants and Microplastics

Flame retardants (FRs), particularly brominated flame retardants (BFRs), are another class of chemicals that interact significantly with microplastics:

- **Widespread use:** Over 140 types of flame retardants have been identified, with about 70 belonging to the BFR category. Their use in plastics has increased substantially, with global BFR production rising from 106,000 metric tons in 1989 to 2,035,000 metric tons in 1999.
- **Bioaccumulation:** FRs, especially BFRs, are lipophilic and chemically inert, leading to rapid bioaccumulation. They've been detected in human milk, glaciers, domestic dust, and wastewater treatment sludge.
- **Toxicity:** Many BFRs are classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). Some are toxic, suspected carcinogens, and act as endocrine disruptors.
- **Interaction with microplastics:** BFRs, particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), readily attach to microplastics in the marine environment. For instance, much higher concentrations of PBDEs were found on polypropylene (PP) microplastics (9909 ng/g) compared to polyethylene (PE) samples (0.3 ng/g).
- **Bioavailability:** Microplastics can act as vectors for PBDEs, facilitating their uptake by marine organisms. Studies on amphipods showed they could assimilate PBDEs from microplastics, with a preference for higher-brominated congeners.
- **Impact on fish:** Research on European seabass showed that microplastics with sorbed contaminants (including BFRs) led to higher accumulation of these chemicals in the fish, potentially worsening toxic effects on liver metabolism, the immune system, and oxidative stress.

## Implications for Ecosystem and Human Health

The interaction between microplastics, heavy metals, and flame retardants presents several concerns:

- **Enhanced toxicity:** The combination of these pollutants may lead to synergistic toxic effects that are greater than the sum of their individual impacts.
- **Bioaccumulation and biomagnification:** As contaminated microplastics move up the food chain, they may lead to increasing concentrations of heavy metals and FRs in higher trophic levels, potentially including humans who consume seafood.
- **Antibiotic resistance:** Some studies suggest that heavy metals on marine microplastics may contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant human pathogens in marine environments.
- **Long-term environmental persistence:** Both microplastics and many of the adsorbed pollutants are highly persistent in the environment, potentially creating long-lasting contamination issues.
- **Human health risks:** While studies on human health impacts are still in early stages, there are concerns about potential effects on the endocrine system, cellular function, and long-term health outcomes.

This complex interaction between microplastics and other pollutants underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to addressing plastic pollution. It's not just about reducing plastic waste, but also about reconsidering the additives used in plastic production and implementing stricter regulations on the use and disposal of these materials. Future research should focus on understanding the long-term implications of these pollutant interactions and developing effective strategies for mitigation and remediation.

## Environmental Persistence

One of the most concerning aspects of both microplastics and forever chemicals is their persistence in the environment:

- **Microplastics:** Environmental lifetimes are believed to range from thousands to millions of years. They can transport across vast distances, with microplastics found in remote locations like Arctic sea ice.
- **Forever Chemicals:** PFAS are extremely stable and can persist in the environment for decades or even centuries. They have been found in remote locations and can biomagnify up the food chain.

## Action Steps: What Can We Do?

Given these alarming findings, it's crucial that we take action:

- **Search Oasis**  
  Check Oasis first for products with confirmed lower microplastic and PFAS levels.
- **Reduce Plastic Use:**  
  Minimize your use of single-use plastics. A single person's efforts can prevent hundreds of plastic items from entering the environment annually.

- **Support Plastic-Free Initiatives:**  
  Back businesses and organizations working to reduce plastic waste. Look for products with plastic-free packaging.

- **Proper Disposal:**  
  Ensure plastic waste is disposed of correctly. Proper recycling can reduce the amount of plastic entering the environment by up to 40%.

- **Educate Others:**  
  Share information about these environmental threats. Increased awareness can lead to collective action.

- **Choose Natural Fibers:**  
  Opt for clothing made from natural fibers. Synthetic clothes can release up to 700,000 microfibers in a single wash.

- **Filter Your Water:**  
  Use a water filter that can remove microplastics and some forever chemicals. Some filters can remove particles as small as 0.5 μm.

## Conclusion

The issues of nanoplastics and forever chemicals represent significant environmental and health challenges for our time. As research continues to unveil the extent and impact of these pollutants, it becomes increasingly clear that urgent action is needed at all levels - from individual choices to global policy changes. By staying informed and taking proactive steps, we can work towards mitigating these threats and preserving the health of our planet and its inhabitants for future generations.
