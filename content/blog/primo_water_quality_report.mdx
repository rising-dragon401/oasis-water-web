# Primo Ingredients

- Sodium Bicarbonate
- Sodium Sulfate

**Sodium Bicarbonate**

In the realm of health and wellness, Sodium Bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, has garnered attention for its potential effects when dissolved in drinking water. This compound, with its alkaline nature and simple chemical structure, is often viewed through a scientific lens for its physiological impacts. We navigate through the science and subtleties of Sodium Bicarbonate, examining its benefits and possible drawbacks:

- **Alkalizing Agent**: Sodium Bicarbonate is known for its ability to raise the pH level of water. This alkaline nature can help neutralize excess stomach acid, providing relief from conditions like heartburn and indigestion.

- **Electrolyte Replenishment**: In situations of mild dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, Sodium Bicarbonate in water can serve as a quick replenishing agent, aiding in restoring the body's natural balance.

- **Exercise Endurance**: Some studies suggest that Sodium Bicarbonate can enhance physical performance, particularly in high-intensity activities, by buffering lactic acid accumulation in muscles.

However, it's imperative to be aware of potential downsides:

- **Sodium Overload**: Regular consumption of Sodium Bicarbonate increases sodium intake, which can be a concern for individuals with hypertension or heart disease. Excess sodium can exacerbate these conditions.

- **Altered Digestive Balance**: Overuse can disrupt the natural acid-base balance in the stomach, potentially leading to digestive issues or alkalosis if consumed in large quantities.

- **Interaction with Medications**: Sodium Bicarbonate can interact with certain medications, altering their effectiveness. It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before regular use, especially if on medication.

Understanding Sodium Bicarbonate in this holistic yet scientifically grounded manner allows for its informed use, recognizing both its potential health benefits and the importance of mindful consumption.

**Sodium Sulfate**
Sodium Sulfate, often encountered in various industrial and consumer products, presents a unique profile when it comes to its impact on human health, especially when consumed in drinking water. As we delve into the scientific nuances of this compound, it's important to explore both its potential therapeutic applications and the concerns associated with its intake:

- **Laxative Effect**: Sodium Sulfate is known for its osmotic laxative properties. It can draw water into the colon, which helps alleviate constipation. However, this should only be considered for short-term relief and under medical supervision.

- **Detoxification Theories**: Some alternative health practices suggest that Sodium Sulfate may aid in detoxifying the body. These claims often stem from a new-age perspective and lack substantial scientific backing.

- **Possible Hydration Benefits**: In specific formulations, Sodium Sulfate might contribute to the electrolyte balance in hydration solutions, although this is a less common use.

On the other hand, there are noteworthy concerns:

- **Dehydration Risk**: Due to its laxative effect, excessive consumption can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and other related issues.

- **Digestive System Distress**: Overuse can irritate the digestive system, leading to symptoms like nausea, bloating, and diarrhea.

- **Interference with Nutrient Absorption**: High levels of Sodium Sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients, potentially leading to deficiencies over time.

In summary, while Sodium Sulfate may have specific uses in medical contexts, its inclusion in drinking water should be approached with caution, considering both its limited benefits and potential risks to health.

Legend:

- ND = Not Detected, absent or present at less than testing method detection level
- mg/L = milligram per liter = ppm = parts per million
- ≤ = compliance with less than or equal to the FDA Standard of Quality (allowable level)
- pCi/L = picoCuries per liter
- NTU = turbidity unit of measurement
- umhos = Micromhos, the reciprocal of microohms
- TDS = Total Dissolved Solids (Minerals)
