# Primo Ingredients

- Sodium Bicarbonate
- Sodium Sulfate

**Sodium Bicarbonate**

Sodium Bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is a compound that dissolves in water to form sodium and bicarbonate, creating an alkaline solution. This attribute has made it a popular choice for various health-related uses. Let's delve into its impact when consumed in drinking water:

- **Neutralizes Stomach Acid**: Its ability to neutralize acid can alleviate conditions like indigestion, which arises from excess stomach acid. This property is beneficial for those suffering from heartburn, providing temporary relief.
- **Oral Health**: Small clinical trials have indicated that a sodium bicarbonate rinse can increase saliva pH, making it less acidic. This is crucial for maintaining dental enamel and may be beneficial for individuals with mouth sores or undergoing treatments like chemotherapy.
- **Athletic Performance**: Some studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate supplements can enhance performance in high-intensity exercises. However, it's important to note that these effects might also be partly attributed to the placebo effect.
- **Kidney Health**: In cases of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, sodium bicarbonate can help reverse blood acidity. This might slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, although more research is needed for conclusive evidence.

Potential Side Effects

- **Gastrointestinal Discomfort**: Common side effects include abdominal bloating, nausea, and stomach pain. In some cases, these symptoms can become severe.
- **Allergic Reactions**: Although rare, severe allergic reactions to sodium bicarbonate are possible, manifesting as breathing difficulties, itchiness, and rashes.
- **Contraindications**: It is advised to avoid sodium bicarbonate for those on sodium-restricted diets, as it increases sodium levels in the bloodstream. Also, excessive use can lead to kidney problems and should be used cautiously, especially in individuals with existing kidney conditions.
- **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**: There is limited data on its safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pregnant individuals may experience fluid buildup and low blood acid levels, making it important to consult healthcare providers before use.

Sodium bicarbonate in drinking water can offer several health benefits, particularly in neutralizing stomach acid and improving oral health. However, it's important to be aware of potential side effects and consult with healthcare professionals, especially in cases of existing health conditions or dietary restrictions.

**Sodium Sulfate**
Sodium Sulfate, often encountered in various industrial and consumer products, presents a unique profile when it comes to its impact on human health, especially when consumed in drinking water. As we delve into the scientific nuances of this compound, it's important to explore both its potential therapeutic applications and the concerns associated with its intake:

- **Laxative Effect**: Sodium Sulfate is known for its osmotic laxative properties. It can draw water into the colon, which helps alleviate constipation. However, this should only be considered for short-term relief and under medical supervision.

- **Detoxification Theories**: Some alternative health practices suggest that Sodium Sulfate may aid in detoxifying the body. These claims often stem from a new-age perspective and lack substantial scientific backing.

- **Possible Hydration Benefits**: In specific formulations, Sodium Sulfate might contribute to the electrolyte balance in hydration solutions, although this is a less common use.

On the other hand, there are noteworthy concerns:

- **Dehydration Risk**: Due to its laxative effect, excessive consumption can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and other related issues.

- **Digestive System Distress**: Overuse can irritate the digestive system, leading to symptoms like nausea, bloating, and diarrhea.

- **Interference with Nutrient Absorption**: High levels of Sodium Sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients, potentially leading to deficiencies over time.

In summary, while Sodium Sulfate may have specific uses in medical contexts, its inclusion in drinking water should be approached with caution, considering both its limited benefits and potential risks to health.

Legend:

- ND = Not Detected, absent or present at less than testing method detection level
- mg/L = milligram per liter = ppm = parts per million
- ≤ = compliance with less than or equal to the FDA Standard of Quality (allowable level)
- pCi/L = picoCuries per liter
- NTU = turbidity unit of measurement
- umhos = Micromhos, the reciprocal of microohms
- TDS = Total Dissolved Solids (Minerals)
