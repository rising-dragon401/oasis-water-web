## Fiji Overview

**Oaisys score:** 60 / 100

**Owner and Manufacturer**: Fiji Water Company.

**Treatment process**: This water is naturally filtered and replenished by rainfall and volcanic activity in the area, which contributes to its mineral content and taste. The water is botled at source
by pumping water through a sealed deliver system free of human contact. The water is filtered to remove any particle matter, micron-filtered to remove microbiological particles,
and ultra violet light is applied to ensure disenfection.

**Source**: artesian aquifer in the Yaqara Valley of Fiji's main island, Viti Levu.

**pH level**: 7.7

**Flouride level**: 0.2 ppm

## Fiji Ingredients

- Silica
- Calcium, Magnesium and Biocarbonates (Hard water)
- Dissolved solids

**Effects of Silica**

Silica, known scientifically as silicon dioxide (SiO2), is a natural compound found ubiquitously in our environment. It forms when silicon bonds with oxygen and often occurs alongside various minerals. In water, silica appears in two distinct forms: reactive and colloidal. Reactive silica involves monomeric molecules interacting with other substances, whereas colloidal silica consists of tiny, suspended non-porous particles.

The Impact of Silica on Human Health

- **Neuroprotective Potential**: Research indicates that silica in drinking water might offer protective effects against cognitive decline. Lower silica levels in water have been associated with increased risks of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairments, particularly in areas with elevated aluminum concentrations. This suggests that silica could counteract the harmful effects of aluminum on the brain.
- **Inherent Safety**: Typically, silica is considered harmless in the small amounts found in drinking water. It is a naturally occurring component in various foods, including grains, vegetables, and fruits.
- **Vital Role in Health**: Emerging studies highlight silica's importance in maintaining good health, though it lacks a defined Recommended Daily Intake. Insufficient silica intake can lead to bone deformities, joint issues, reduced collagen production, and imbalanced bone mineralization.
- **Low Risk of Toxicity**: There is minimal data on the toxicity of silica in water due to its assumed safety. Animal studies have shown that even high levels (50,000 ppm) of dietary silica do not produce adverse effects, emphasizing its low toxicity.

Points of Consideration

- **Aesthetic Implications**: High silica content in water can cause scratching and spotting on glassware and fixtures, similar to the effects of hard water. It may also lead to scale buildup in appliances, diminishing their efficiency.
- **Taste and Consumption**: Water with high colloidal silica levels can have an unappealing appearance due to floating particles, potentially reducing water consumption and increasing the risk of dehydration.
- **Beverage Quality**: When used in brewing tea or coffee, silica particles can react and alter the taste and quality of these beverages.

Silica in drinking water is generally safe and might offer significant health benefits, particularly regarding cognitive health. However, its presence is more of an aesthetic concern in daily life. The potential health advantages of silica, along with its essential role in human biology, make it an interesting component of our water sources.

**Calcium, Magnesium and Biocarbonates (Hard water)**
Calcium and Magnesium, key minerals found in our drinking water, are not just elements on the periodic table but vital players in our daily health.
Often found in 'hard water', their roles in our well-being have been the focus of numerous studies. Let's dive into what these minerals mean for our health.

Calcium

- **Health Necessities**: More than just a bone-builder, calcium is critical for muscle function, nerve signaling, and keeping our blood in check.
- **When Lacking**: Watch out for weakened bones (osteoporosis), rickets, and even high blood pressure.
- **Water's Gift**: Surprisingly, it can keep those pesky kidney stones at bay.

Magnesium

- **The Silent Hero**: Powers over 350 enzyme systems, juggles energy production, DNA synthesis, heart health, and hormonal balance.
- **Deficiency Dangers**: Low levels can silently usher in osteoporosis, resistance to insulin, metabolic issues, and up the ante for heart diseases.
- **CVD Shield**: Our heart's ally, magnesium in water may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Bicarbonates:

- **Digestive Aid**: They help neutralize stomach acid, offering relief from indigestion and heartburn.
- **pH Balancer**: Bicarbonates assist in maintaining the body’s pH balance, crucial for smooth biological functioning.
- **Water Softening**: In water, bicarbonates contribute to temporary hardness, which can be easily removed, improving water quality.

The Research

- **Varied Voices in Studies**: Research shows a mixed bag – some studies suggest less heart disease with higher water hardness, especially due to magnesium.
- **Magnesium's Spotlight**: Some studies pinpoint a drop in heart disease risk with higher magnesium levels in water, especially around 10 mg/L.

Nutrition

- **The Intake Puzzle**: From one corner of the globe to another, many aren't getting enough of these minerals, with a stark gap in developing regions.
- **Absorption Adventures**: How well we absorb these minerals depends on their source – water being a surprisingly efficient one.

Health Impacts Unraveled

- **Heart Health Harmony**: Magnesium is a maestro in managing heart function and blood vessel health. Low levels can lead to rhythm disturbances.
- **Safety First**: Upping calcium and magnesium is generally safe, barring those with significant kidney issues.

Water Wisdom

- **Remineralizing the Essence**: Especially for desalinated water, adding these minerals back is crucial to prevent pipe damage and maintain nutritional value.
- **Taste vs. Health**: Consumer preferences often guide mineral additions in bottled water and beverages.

**Effects of Dissolved Solids**

Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) encompass a variety of substances in water, primarily inorganic salts and some organic matter. These components are critical in assessing water quality and its appropriateness for consumption. Here's an in-depth look at how Dissolved Solids impact human health:

Introduction to Total Dissolved Solids

- TDS in water comprise both organic and inorganic substances.
- They primarily include inorganic salts like calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates, along with some organic substances.
- The measure of TDS, expressed in parts per million (ppm), serves as a key indicator of water quality.

Effects on Human Health

- **Nutritional Contribution**: Elements like calcium and magnesium in TDS can enhance the nutritional value of water.
- **Taste Enhancement**: Water with TDS levels in the range of 300 to 600 ppm is often considered to taste better.
- **Essential Minerals**: Moderate amounts of certain TDS elements are crucial for health.

Potential Risks

- **Excessive TDS Levels**: TDS levels above 500 ppm can deteriorate water taste and may pose health risks. The EPA's recommended maximum is 500 ppm.
- **Associated Contaminants**: High TDS levels may coincide with the presence of harmful substances, including heavy metals like lead or arsenic.
- **Hard Water Challenges**: Elevated TDS often means hard water, leading to scaling in pipes and appliances.

Additional Considerations

- **Impact of Water Treatment**: Water purification methods might reduce beneficial minerals in TDS alongside harmful components.
- **Importance of Balanced TDS**: Maintaining an optimal TDS level in drinking water is essential for health and taste.

In essence, Dissolved Solids in water present a complex scenario. While they are key to imparting essential minerals and affecting water taste, an imbalance, especially in higher concentrations, can have adverse effects on health and home appliances. It's vital to keep TDS levels in check to ensure water quality and safety for everyday use.
