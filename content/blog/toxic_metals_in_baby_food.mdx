Moms Across America collaborated with GMOScience and The New MDS to test toxic metals in baby formula, and the results are shocking.

## The Study: Methodology and Scope

The research team, led by Dr. Michelle Perro, a veteran pediatrician with 43 years of experience, examined 20 distinct formula types, with each type tested twice. The study focused on five toxic metals known to pose significant health risks:

1. Aluminum
2. Lead
3. Arsenic
4. Mercury
5. Cadmium

Formulas were selected based on various criteria, including:

- Presence of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)
- Organic vs. non-organic options
- Dairy-based and soy-based formulas
- US and international brands
- Formulas commonly available through government assistance programs like WIC

The testing was conducted using state-of-the-art laboratory techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability of results.

## Key Findings: A Closer Look at the Data

The results of the study were, to put it mildly, concerning:

- **100% of samples** contained detectable levels of aluminum and lead
- **80% of samples** had lead levels exceeding EPA drinking water standards
- **57% of samples** tested positive for arsenic
- **55% of samples** contained mercury
- **35% of samples** had detectable levels of cadmium
- **Six formulas** tested positive for all five toxic metals in both samples

### Most Alarming Discovery

A goat's milk baby formula showed aluminum levels at 41,000 ppb, which is:

- 4,000 to 40,000 times higher than other metals tested
- 200 times higher than EPA allowable levels in drinking water
- Exceeding FDA safety limits for premature infants

## Understanding the Dangers of Heavy Metals

The presence of toxic metals in infant formula is particularly concerning due to the unique vulnerability of infants. Dr. Perro explains:

"Infants are at a critical stage of development, with rapidly growing bodies and developing organ systems. Their ability to detoxify harmful substances is not yet fully developed, making them especially susceptible to the negative effects of toxic metals."

### Health Risks Associated with Toxic Metals

1. **Aluminum**:

   - Can accumulate in the brain, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders
   - May interfere with bone formation and mineral metabolism

2. **Lead**:

   - Even low levels can impair cognitive development and lower IQ
   - Can cause behavioral problems and learning difficulties

3. **Arsenic**:

   - Known carcinogen
   - Can affect neurological development and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease later in life

4. **Mercury**:

   - Neurotoxin that can impair brain development
   - May cause delays in fine motor skills and cognitive function

5. **Cadmium**:
   - Can damage kidneys and bones
   - Potential carcinogen

Dr. Perro further notes, "What's particularly concerning is the potential for synergistic effects when multiple toxic metals are present. The combined impact could be greater than the sum of individual exposures, a phenomenon we don't yet fully understand."

## Best and Worst Performers

The study ranked formulas based on their contamination levels. Here are the results:

### Least Contaminated Formulas:

1. Kirkland ProCare Non-GMO
2. Similac Sensitive
3. PurAmino Hypoallergenic

### Most Contaminated Formulas:

1. Total Comfort
2. Up & Up Gentle Premium Powder
3. Up & Up Non-GMO Hypoallergenic Powder
4. Enfamil Plant-Based Soy Powder

It's important to note that even the "best" performers still contained detectable levels of toxic metals, highlighting the pervasive nature of this issue.

## Industry Response and Regulatory Landscape

The study's findings raise serious questions about the current regulatory framework and industry practices. Dr. Renee Joy Dufault, a contributor to the study, noted:

"There were no common ingredients to explain any of the elevated levels except for corn syrup solids and vegetable oils."

This observation suggests that contamination may be occurring at various points in the supply chain, from raw ingredient sourcing to manufacturing processes.

Currently, the FDA does not have specific limits for most toxic metals in infant formula, relying instead on broader food safety regulations. This regulatory gap has allowed for a wide range of contamination levels across different brands and products.

## Urgent Call to Action

The study's authors are calling for immediate action on multiple fronts:

1. **Enhanced Regulations**: Stricter guidelines and permissible limits for toxic metals in infant formula are needed.
2. **Regular Testing**: Mandatory routine testing should be enforced to ensure compliance.
3. **Transparent Reporting**: Companies should be required to disclose test results publicly.
4. **Improved Manufacturing**: Formula makers must implement rigorous controls over raw materials and production processes.
5. **Research and Development**: Investment in technologies to remove or reduce heavy metal content in formulas.

## What Parents Can Do

In light of these findings, parents and caregivers are advised to:

1. **Prioritize Breastfeeding**: When possible, opt for breastfeeding as the safest option.
2. **Choose Wisely**: If formula is necessary, select brands with lower levels of contaminants.
3. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest research on infant formula safety.
4. **Advocate for Change**: Support initiatives calling for stricter regulations and safer products.
5. **Consult Healthcare Providers**: Discuss concerns and potential supplementation to mitigate risks.

## Take Action Now

1. Contact your senators and representatives to:
   - Include baby formula in the Baby Food Safety Act of 2024
   - Remove pre-emption clauses that could weaken regulation
2. Sign petitions urging Congress to empower the FDA to enforce stronger safety standards
3. Share this information with other parents and caregivers
4. Consider consulting with healthcare professionals about supplements that may help offset toxicity
5. Support organizations working towards safer food standards for infants and children

## Looking Forward

While the findings of this study are undoubtedly concerning, they also represent an opportunity for positive change. By raising awareness and demanding action, we can work towards a future where parents can feel confident in the safety of the nutrition they provide their infants.

Dr. Perro concludes, "This is not just about one study or one type of product. It's about recognizing that our children's health is interconnected with the health of our environment, our food systems, and our regulatory frameworks. We have the knowledge and the capability to do better. Now, we need the will to make it happen."

By working together – parents, healthcare providers, researchers, industry leaders, and policymakers – we can ensure a safer, healthier future for our most vulnerable population: our babies.
