## Research findings

A recent study by Ismail Ogulur and colleagues found dishwasher rinse aid, but not detergent, was found to be cytotoxic to human intestinal epithelial cells and disrupt epithelial barrier integrity at concentrations similar to residues left on dishware after washing.

The main component responsible for these harmful effects was identified as alcohol ethoxylates in the rinse aid.

Rinse aid treatment altered gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells, promoting inflammation and cell migration.

The study suggests that residues from professional dishwasher rinse aids may potentially contribute to intestinal epithelial damage and inflammation, which could be related to the increased prevalence of allergic and inflammatory diseases in recent decades.

Washing tables can contain a myriad of hidden chemcials which are often never completely rinses off and can stick onto our dishes after each cleaning cycle.

## Dishwasher Alternatives

The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating alcohol ethoxylate concentrations in rinse aids and encourages the search for safer alternatives to protect public health.

## Natural Alternatives to Dish Soap and Detergent

The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating alcohol ethoxylate concentrations in rinse aids and encourages the search for safer alternatives to protect public health.

While traditional dish soap is effective for cleaning dishes, there are natural alternatives that you can consider:

- **Castile Soap:** Castile soap is a plant-based soap made from vegetable oils. It is gentle and can be used for various cleaning purposes, including washing dishes. (You've probably heard of Dr. Bronner's)
- **Baking Soda:** Baking soda is a versatile cleaning agent. It can help remove grease and grime from dishes. Mix it with water to form a paste or sprinkle it directly on dishes and scrub.
- **White Vinegar:** White vinegar has natural antibacterial properties and can help cut through grease. Mix it with water to create a cleaning solution for your dishes.
- **Lemon Juice:** The acidity of lemon juice makes it effective in cutting through grease and removing odors. It also leaves a fresh citrus scent. Mix it with water to create a cleaning solution.
- **Salt:** Salt can be used as a gentle abrasive to help scrub dishes. It's especially useful for removing stuck-on food. This works especially well with boiling water to remove burnt-on bits.
- **Cornstarch:** Mix cornstarch with a bit of water to create a paste that can be used for cleaning dishes. It can help remove stains and leave dishes shiny.
- **Coconut Oil:** While it might seem counterintuitive, coconut oil can be used to break down grease on dishes. However, it's important to note that it may leave a residue, so use it sparingly.

It's also important to note, traditional sponges are made from synthetic materials and can take centuries to decompose. Opt for natural sponges made from loofah or plant-based cellulose, which are biodegradable and perform well.

## Making informed decisions

The Ogulur study on dishwashing residues is a reminder of the interconnectedness of our daily choices and our overall health. By selecting safer more natural cleaning products, we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from potential harm while also caring for the planet.
