Bottled Water Tested For Fluoride

(289+ Brands Tested) + Top Picks

**Truth About Fluoride In Bottled Water…**

When it comes to bottled water and fluoride, overall itʼs pretty good.

Most brands either filter their water or have naturally filtered water

that contains little fluoride. But there are some brands that are better

than others and a few brands high in fluoride to be aware of.

So letʼs get started.

1

**How To Choose The Best Bottled Water…**

When it comes to choosing the best bottled water, there are 6 factors you

should consider:

1\. Fluoride content

2\. Microplastic levels

3\. Container material

4\. Minerals + additives

5\. Other toxins

6\. Source of water

**1. FLUORIDE CONTENT**

When it comes to fluoride, obviously we want levels to be as low as

possible. But avoiding fluoride and its negative health eﬀects isnʼt the only

benefit that comes with low fluoride levels. For example, since fluoride is

one of the hardest chemicals to filter, we know brands with low levels of

fluoride have filtered their water properly.

While for the brands that oﬀer natural water (unfiltered water, straight from

the source) we can be fairly confident their water is not contaminated. As

fluoride is a common contaminant. Natural fluoride levels in drinking water

are also on average 0.05 ppm. So thatʼs what you should aim for.

**2. MICROPLASTICS**

I donʼt think this needs much explaining but plastic does not belong in

your body and if it enters your body it can lead to many sad health eﬀects.

Unfortunately, microplastics are very common in bottled water, yet there

aren't that many studies on the topic. But from the research that is

available, we have enough information to know or be confident in knowing

which brands are safe to drink.

**3. CONTAINER MATERIAL**

The container (plastic or glass) is also something to keep in mind.

Clearly, glass is the better choice since plastic containers could easily leach

chemicals into the water. And more oꢀen than not, water sold in glass

containers is of better quality and thus healthier for you.

But I know buying bottled water in glass can get expensive. So in that case,

you should look into buying a [water](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[filter](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[that](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[removes](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[fluoride](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/). This way

you can save money AND have water that is healthy to drink.

**4. MINERALS + ADDITIVES**

Along with the possible reasons mentioned above, minerals and additives

are another reason you should pass on most bottled water.

The reason I say this is because a majority of bottled water is filtered water

which then has minerals added back in. The problem is, these minerals are

unnatural and of lower quality compared to real minerals found in nature

(water and food).

However, thatʼs just one issue. Brands of bottled water can also add other

things into their product. Such as poor quality salt, artificial flavors and

natural flavors. All of which have negative eﬀects on your health.

_So whatʼs the solution?_

Your best best bet is to go with water that has naturally occurring minerals

and nothing added to it. This is the type of water humans have been

drinking for thousands of years and the kind of water thatʼs healthiest for

you (your next best bet would be to filter it yourself).

**5. OTHER TOXINS**

3

{'<'}a name="br4">{'<'}/a>{' '}

Even if fluoride levels are low and all the other things above are covered.

Itʼs still possible for other issues to be present in bottled water.

For example, if you take a look at a brand like Perrier. It looks like a solid

choice. Itʼs low in fluoride (0.1 ppm), comes in a glass bottle and is natural

spring water. But recent reports showed high levels of PFAS in Perrierʼs

sparkling bottled water. So that takes it oﬀ the list. While the very same

thing applies to a brand like Topo Chico. Looks good but then the PFAS

levels were through the roof.

**6. SOURCE OF WATER**

One of the biggest problems with bottled water is that brands use various

sources for their bottled water. For example, a brand like Kikrland (Costco)

can sell a bottle of spring water that looks the same all over the world. But

when you compare a bottle bought in Florida, USA and LA, California - the

water inside it will come from two diﬀerent places and as a result be

completely diﬀerent.

One bottle may have 0.0 ppm of fluoride while the other one can have 0.3

ppm of fluoride or even more. Thatʼs why itʼs best to double check the

“Source” of the water with the information I provide below.

Thatʼs also why I prefer to drink brands that only **take their water from**

**one location**. This way youʼre not guessing and are confident that youʼre

drinking safe and healthy water.

So with that and many other things in mind, let me show you what brands I

strongly believe are the best…

**The Best Brands Of Bottled Water (USA, CAD, UK)**

● Fluoride-free, 0.0 ppm fluoride content

when tested by me

● Very low levels of microplastics

● Comes in both glass and plastic bottles

● Natural water from the French Alps, that

**Evian**

contains all your healthy minerals

● Mountain Valley, Icelandic Glacial, Eska,

San Benedetto, Acqua Panna, Highland

Spring, Aqua Carpatica

**Other Options**

**Important:** There are only 2 scenarios I recommend when it comes to

drinking water, both have their pros and cons.

The first one is truly the only way that oﬀers 100% confidence in water

quality, and thatʼs to use a water filter.

The main reason for this is because YOUʼRE in control of the WHOLE

process. So nothing can go wrong, as long as you get a quality water filter.

So if youʼre interested, I highly recommend you go to my [fluoride](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[water](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)

[filters](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[guide](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)(link to guide).

The second scenario I recommend is drinking bottled water from brands

mentioned above (natural + in glass + low in fluoride and other toxins).

While when it comes to other brands of bottled water. Itʼs just not worth it...

besides the microplastics, unnatural minerals, and additives, you just canʼt

be sure whatʼs inside the bottle. AND to add insult to injury, youʼre over

paying for it.

Now thereʼs lots to say about all of this, so if you'd like to read more scroll

down to the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section.

**MUST READ INFORMATION**

Besides having low fluoride levels. The most important thing is to check

the “Source” of the water bottle. Which basically means where the

company got the water from (lake, river, aquifer, etc). As explained above,

you can have a brand sell a bottle of water that looks exactly the same but

has completely diﬀerent water in it. So by doing this, youʼll be 100% sure

the bottle of water your drinking is low in fluoride.

Now here are some tips to help you out…

**1.** You can find the source of the bottled water on the label. If you can not

find what the source is, itʼs most likely filtered. And if it says something like

“Purified” or “Distilled” then itʼs most definitely fluoride-free.

**2.** Search for the name of the brand. This will help you find the information

faster. If youʼre on your computer you can click the buttons “Ctrlʼ + “F” and

then type the name of the brand.

**3.** If you can not use that search feature, the list has been put in

alphabetical order from A-Z followed by numbers. So just scroll until you

find the letter the brand you're looking for starts with.

**4.** If the Source says “Filtered” it means where they get the water from does

not matter since theyʼve filtered the water. And all their water should

contain the same amount of fluoride.

**5.** If the source says “Single Source” this means the brand gets their water

from one location. So it does not matter what the source is since the

fluoride levels will all be the same.

**6.** If the source says “Unknown” the brand has not made this information

known or easy to find. This makes it a riskier and unknown since there is a

higher chance the fluoride levels are diﬀerent.

**FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)**

**1. Why would you recommend filtered water over bottled water?**

A. For the main reason YOU control the ENTIRE process. This way you

donʼt have to trust a company. And as long as you get a quality water

filter, youʼll be able to get water just as good if not better than what's

found in bottled water. Plus youʼll be able to avoid plastic bottles by

using glass or stainless steel water bottles. Which is great for your

health and the environment.

**2. When would you recommend bottled water over filtered?**

A. If itʼs bottled water that contains natural water (water that comes

straight from the source, has its healthy minerals, has nothing added

to it and is low in fluoride). For the main reason that thereʼs no better

water than water in its most natural state. Itʼs not damaged by the

chemicals used in city treatment facilities and contains all the natural

substances commonly found in water.

**3. Are there any cons to buying natural water?**

A. Hands down, natural water should be the best option. Itʼs exactly

how nature intended the water to be and nothing beats natural. The

only problem I have is that the world isnʼt as pristine as it once was.

Which means that natural water might be contaminated. But if itʼs

not (a brand low in fluoride + other good signs) then itʼs definitely

better than filtered water. Iʼd rather just know without a doubt so

thatʼs why I personally go with filtered water, but to each their own.

Filtered water is also way more convenient compared to bottled

water, so thatʼs something to keep in mind.

**4. Which water filter should I buy?**

A. Unfortunately, many brands lie about their filters being able to

remove fluoride. So youʼll need to watch out for that. But an easy

22

solution to this problem would be to follow my [guide](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)[ ](https://truthaboutfluoride.com/water-filters-that-remove-fluoride/)on choosing a

fluoride water filter.

**5. What about beneficial minerals being lost during filtering?**

A. By far, this question is the most mis-understood... When it comes to

the beneficial minerals found in water, YES theyʼre very important.

But tap water does not contain many beneficial minerals, the few it

does have are poor quality and are most likely very damaged by the

harsh chemicals used in treatment facilities. So if youʼre filtering tap

water, youʼll want to pass on these minerals anyways.

Now I wouldnʼt rely on water as your main source of these minerals.

You wonʼt get enough and if a brand adds these beneficial minerals

in, theyʼre not going to be of the best quality. Theyʼll be artificial and

your body reacts diﬀerently to natural and artificial minerals. So

whatʼs the solution?

The solution is to add these beneficial minerals through your diet or

even throw a pinch into your filtered water. And the best way of doing

so is using a quality salt. This means you should use quality sea salt

or even better, Redmond Real Salt (my favorite salt). But whatever

you do, do not use white salt.

**6. What if a brand is not on your list, is it safe to drink?**

A. As long as the brand follows what Iʼve outlined here (natural, low in

fluoride, no additives, comes in glass) it should be good. Now if

youʼre not sure, email me the name of the brand and Iʼll tell you.

**8. Flavoured water recommendation?**

A. Thereʼs only one brand I could recommend. Thatʼs because every

other brand of flavoured water uses natural flavors, which is an

ingredient you should stay away from. As “natural flavors” are far

from being natural and in fact could contain many chemicals. So your

best bet is to go with a brand like Spindriꢀ since they use real

squeezed fruit for their drinks. Iʼve also confirmed that it contains no

fluoride (filtered water) .
