Bottled water might seem like a pure and simple solution to your hydration needs, but
it's worth taking a closer look. While it's often marketed as 'natural' and 'clean,'
the reality is that the contents of each bottle can vary significantly depending on its
source and the processes it's undergone. Some bottled waters contain added minerals for taste,
while others might have trace amounts of contaminants, despite rigorous filtration processes.

## How To Choose The Best Bottled Water

When it comes to choosing the best bottled water, there are 6 factors you should consider:

1. Fluoride Content: Look for water with low fluoride levels to keep this controversial chemical to a minimum.
2. Microplastic Levels: Demand clear information from companies about any microplastics in their water; your health deserves purity.
3. Container Material: Select bottles that are kind to your wellbeing and the environment, such as those without BPA and that are recyclable.
4. Minerals + Additives: Prefer water that naturally contains beneficial minerals and is free from unnecessary additives.
5. Other Toxins: Stay informed about any potential toxins that might be in the water you're drinking.
6. Source of Water: Make sure the water you choose comes from a clean and uncontaminated source.

## 1. Flouride Content

When discussing fluoride, we aim for minimal levels due to associated health risks.
Low fluoride concentrations also suggest that water has been effectively filtered,
especially since it's a challenging substance to remove. Brands with low fluoride are
likely implementing robust filtration methods. Conversely, brands offering unfiltered, natural
water are generally expected to have minimal contamination, given that natural sources typically
contain around 0.05 ppm of fluoride.

## 2. Micropalstic Levels

Regarding microplastics, the consensus is clear: they have no place in our bodies
and can cause various health issues. Even though there's limited research on microplastics
in bottled water, available studies enable us to identify which brands are less likely to
pose a risk. Always stay informed and select your water wisely, prioritizing both your health
and the planet's well-being.

## 3. Container Material

When considering the material of the container for your water—be it plastic or glass—it's essential to
weigh the options. Glass is typically preferred over plastic, as it eliminates the concern of chemical
leaching into the water, which can occur with plastic containers. Often, water housed in glass tends
to be of superior quality and, consequently, a healthier choice.

However, the cost factor is real; glass-bottled water can be a significant expense.
In such cases, a reliable water filter, once tested and verified, can serve as an economical and
effective substitute for bottled water.

## 4. Minerals & Additives

Many brands simply filter their water and reintroduce minerals artificially. These synthetic
minerals are typically of inferior quality when compared to those naturally present in water
and food sources.

Moreover, it's not just about minerals. Certain water brands might also add subpar salt,
artificial flavors, or so-called "natural flavors," which could be detrimental to your health over time.

So, what's the advisable course of action? Opt for water that contains naturally occurring
minerals, without any added extras—this is the water humans have been drinking for millennia.
It's the most beneficial for your well-being. If that's not feasible, the next viable option is
filtering your water at home.

## 5. Additional contaminant concerns

Even with fluoride content managed and other factors addressed,
there could still be other contaminants lurking in bottled water.
Take Perrier as an instance – it may seem like a wise choice with
its low fluoride content (0.1 ppm), glass packaging, and natural spring
water origin. However, recent findings have indicated elevated levels of
PFAS in Perrier's sparkling water, which unfortunately disqualifies it.
Similarly, Topo Chico might appear appealing, but it was found to have
exceedingly high PFAS levels, raising concerns.

## 6. Water source

A significant issue with bottled water is the diversity of sources from which
brands procure their water. Consider Kirkland (Costco) - they market spring
water that looks uniform globally. Yet, a bottle purchased in Florida, USA
compared to one from LA, California will contain water from two distinct sources,
leading to potential differences in quality. One may have no detectable fluoride,
whereas the other could contain 0.3 ppm or more. Therefore, it's crucial to verify
the water's source with the information provided below.

This is also why I have a preference for brands that exclusively source their water
from a single locale, ensuring consistency and peace of mind about the water's safety
and quality.

Now, keeping these and other factors in mind, I'm ready to introduce you to the brands
that I firmly believe stand out as the best…

## The Best Brands Of Bottled Water

Requirements:

- Must be fluoride-free, with a 0.0 ppm fluoride content as per testing
- Should contain very low levels of microplastics
- Availability in both glass and plastic bottles is necessary
- Originating from natural sources such as the French Alps is preferred

Best brands of bottled water:

- Evian
- Mountain Valley
- Icelandic Glacial
- Eska
- San Benedetto
- Acqua Panna
- Highland Spring
- Aqua Carpatica

## Additional Options

It is recommended to consider only two scenarios for drinking water,
each with its own advantages and drawbacks.

The optimal approach for ensuring 100% confidence in water quality is
to use a water filtration system. The key advantage here is that you have full
control over the filtration process. With a high-quality water filter, the
chances of anything going awry are minimal.

Alternatively, it is recommended to opt for bottled water from the brands
listed above, which offer natural water, packaged in glass, and with low
fluoride and other toxins. When it comes to other bottled water brands, the
risks outweigh the benefits. The presence of microplastics, unnatural minerals,
and additives, coupled with the uncertainty of the water's contents, makes them a
less desirable choice. Not to mention, the cost is often higher than justified.

## More important information

It is imperative to examine not only the fluoride content but also the provenance
of the bottled water brand you choose. This refers to the original body of water
from which the company sources its product, whether it's a lake, river, or underground
aquifer. Understanding this ensures that even if two bottles appear identical,
they may contain vastly different water. Confirming the source is a definitive
step to guarantee that the water you're consuming has low fluoride levels.

Here are some strategies to assist you:

1. The source information is often listed on the bottle's label. Absence of this
   detail typically implies the water has been filtered. Labels that indicate "Purified" or
   "Distilled" suggest the water is devoid of fluoride.
2. Look up the brand name for quicker access to information. On a computer, the shortcut
   Command + “F” can expedite your search.
3. If you're not using the search function, the brands are organized alphabetically
   and then numerically for your convenience. Simply navigate to the section that matches
   the first letter of the brand you are searching for.
4. The term “Filtered” on the label signifies the original water source is irrelevant
   due to the filtration process, which standardizes the fluoride content.
5. “Single Source” indicates that the company uses one consistent source, ensuring
   uniform fluoride levels regardless of the specific origin.
6. If the source is listed as “Unknown,” the brand has not disclosed this information,
   which may suggest variability in fluoride content and presents a higher risk.

## Other common questions

**Do Water Filters Remove Essential Minerals?**

It's a common misconception that water filters strip away all the
beneficial minerals from water. Indeed, minerals are essential for our health,
but the truth is, tap water isn't a significant source of these nutrients.
The minerals that are present in tap water can be of questionable quality due
to potential damage from harsh treatment chemicals. When filtering tap water,
you're not missing out on much in terms of beneficial minerals.

It's also worth noting that relying on water alone for your mineral intake isn't a
wise strategy. The quantities are simply too low, and if minerals are added to
water by a brand, they are often not of optimal quality. These synthetic additives
can be treated differently by the body compared to natural minerals.

For an effective solution, incorporate these essential nutrients into your diet.
Alternatively, you can add a pinch of quality salt to your filtered water.
High-quality sea salt, or my personal preference, Redmond Real Salt, are excellent choices.
However, steer clear of regular white table salt, as it's typically stripped of its natural
benefits.

**What about water brands not featured on this list?**

If you come across a water brand that isn't featured on our recommended list,
don't worry. It can still be a viable option as long as it meets the following
criteria: it's natural, low in fluoride, free from additives, and ideally packaged
in glass. If you're uncertain about a brand, reach out with the name, and we can help
determine its suitability.

**Is flavored water ok?**

When it comes to flavored water, there's a sea of options that might not be as healthy
as they claim. Many brands use "natural flavors," a term that unfortunately often encompasses
a variety of undisclosed chemicals. The recommendation here is straightforward: choose brands
like Spindrift, which uses actual squeezed fruit in their beverages, ensuring an all-natural,
fluoride-free refreshment.
