Many of us enjoy a refreshing shower or relaxing bath without realizing that we may be exposing ourselves to a cocktail of potentially harmful toxins. Recent scientific studies have shed light on the surprising amount of contaminants our bodies can absorb through skin contact and inhalation during these daily rituals. Let's dive into the science behind this phenomenon and explore the most prevalent toxins lurking in our water.

## The Skin: More Permeable Than You Think

Our skin, the body's largest organ, is not an impenetrable barrier. In fact, it's remarkably absorbent.

Recent scientific studies have shed light on the surprising amount of contaminants our bodies can absorb through skin contact during showering and bathing. This exposure route is often overlooked but can be a significant contributor to our overall toxin burden.

### Absorption Mechanisms

When we shower or bathe, our skin becomes an efficient absorption surface for various contaminants:

1. **Increased Permeability**: Warm water opens up pores and increases skin permeability, facilitating the absorption of chemicals.
2. **Large Exposure Area**: Nearly the entire body surface is exposed during bathing, maximizing potential absorption.
3. **Extended Contact Time**: Longer showers or baths increase the duration of exposure, allowing more time for chemicals to penetrate the skin.

## Common Water Contaminants and Their Effects

1. **PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)**: Recent research has revealed that PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," can be absorbed through the skin at levels much higher than previously thought. A study using lab-grown tissue resembling human skin found substantial absorption of 15 out of 17 tested PFAS compounds. These chemicals have been linked to serious health issues, including cancer and liver disease.

2. **Chlorine and Chloramines**: Used as disinfectants, these chemicals can be absorbed through the skin and inhaled as vapor during showers. They can cause skin dryness, irritation, and have been associated with respiratory issues.

3. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**: VOCs easily evaporate at room temperature and can be inhaled as steam during hot showers. Some VOCs are known carcinogens and can cause various health problems.

4. **Heavy Metals**: Metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic can be present in water due to contamination or old plumbing. While skin absorption varies, prolonged exposure can lead to accumulation in the body.

5. **Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products**: Trace amounts of medications and cosmetic ingredients often find their way into our water supply. While individual exposure may be low, the long-term effects of chronic exposure are still being studied.

## How Much Do We Actually Absorb?

The amount of toxins absorbed depends on various factors, including water temperature, exposure duration, and the specific contaminants present. However, some studies have provided eye-opening estimates:

- A study on chloroform (a byproduct of chlorination) found that absorption through the skin and inhalation during a 10-minute shower was equivalent to drinking 2 liters of the same water.
- Research on PFAS showed that smaller "short-chain" compounds were absorbed at even higher rates than their longer-chain counterparts.

## Protecting Yourself

Everytime you shower or bathe, you are also exposing yourself to a cocktail of potentially harmful toxins. It's important to take proactive steps in protecting our health.

Some things you can do to reduce your exposure:

While the information may seem alarming, there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure:

1. Install a high-quality shower filter or whole-house filtration system.
2. Reduce shower time and temperature to minimize exposure.
3. Ventilate your bathroom well to reduce inhalation of vaporized contaminants.
4. Stay informed about your local water quality by reviewing annual reports from your water utility.
