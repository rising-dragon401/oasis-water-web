## Brita Filter Overview

**Oaisys score:** 50 / 100

**Owner and Manufacturer**: Clorox Co.

**Filtration method**: Each filter comes with a combination of a activated carbon lining and a fiber matrix to filter out certain contaminants. Depending on the filter they are supposed to filter out some but not all traces of chlorine, lead, mercury, cadmium, benzen, asbestos, copper, zinc, 1, 2, 4 - tricholorobenzene, select pesticides and pharmaceuticals.
According to their website "Brita filters keep a healthy level of fluoride, a water additive that promotes strong teeth.""

**About**: Brita claims their filters remove 99% of lead and reduces most contaminants.

# Chemicals Brita Filters Removes

Depending on the filter they are supposed to filter out some but not all traces of:

- **Chlorine**: In drinking water, can lead to eye and nose irritation; high levels may increase the risk of cancers, such as bladder cancer.
- **Lead**: Consumption in water can cause developmental issues in children, neurological disorders, and kidney damage.
- **Mercury**: Ingestion through water can damage the nervous system, particularly in young children and fetuses.
- **Cadmium**: Exposure via water can result in kidney damage and is associated with an increased risk of bone demineralization and certain cancers.
- **Benzene**: Consuming benzene in water can lead to bone marrow failure, anemia, and increased risk of cancers like leukemia.
- **Asbestos**: Long-term ingestion of asbestos-contaminated water can cause lung diseases, including cancer and mesothelioma.
- **Copper**: High levels of copper in water can lead to gastrointestinal distress and, in severe cases, liver or kidney damage.
- **Zinc**: Excessive zinc in water can cause nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and headaches.
- **1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene**: Consumption through water may impact liver and kidney health and potentially increase cancer risk.
- **Select Pesticides**: Depending on the specific type, pesticides in water can cause a range of health issues, including hormone disruption, nervous system damage, and an increased risk of certain cancers.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: The presence of certain pharmaceuticals in water, though typically at very low concentrations, can potentially lead to long-term health impacts, including hormonal imbalances and antibiotic resistance.

# Chemicals Brita Filters Don't Remove

A recent lawsuit alleges Brita water pitchers, dispensers, and filters are marked deceptively claimin that Brita doesn't actually remove many hazardous chemicals from water.
The complaint points out Brita filters don't actually remove the entirety of the chemicals they claim to.

Depending on where you live and the quality of your tap water, you will find varying levels of toxins in your water. Common ones are listed below.

Some of the chemicals Brita filters don't remove include:

- **Alachor**: Associated with increased cancer risk and liver, kidney, spleen, eye, and nose damage.
- **Arsenic**: Long-term exposure can lead to skin, bladder, and lung cancers; skin discoloration and lesions.
- **Atrazine**: May disrupt endocrine system, linked to birth defects and reproductive disorders.
- **Benzene**: Known carcinogen; can cause bone marrow failure, anemia, and leukemia.
- **Cadmium**: Kidney damage and bone demineralization; linked to respiratory and prostate cancer.
- **Carbon Tetrachloride**: Liver, kidney, and central nervous system damage; potential carcinogen.
- **Chlordane**: Affects nervous system, digestive system, and liver; potential carcinogen.
- **Chlorobenzene**: Can damage liver, kidney, and central nervous system.
- **Chloropicrin**: Eye and respiratory irritant; can cause lung damage.
- **Copper**: High levels can cause gastrointestinal distress and liver or kidney damage.
- **Dibromochloropropane**: Testicular damage and infertility; possible carcinogen.
- **p-Dichlorobenzene**: May harm liver and kidneys; possibly carcinogenic.
- **1,2-Dichloroethane**: Can cause liver and kidney damage; likely carcinogen.
- **1,1-Dichloroethylene**: Potential effects on liver and nervous system; possibly carcinogenic.
- **cis-1,2-Dichloroethylene**: May affect liver; data on health effects limited.
- **trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene**: Limited data, but potential liver and lung effects.
- **1,2-Dichloropropane**: Associated with increased cancer risk.
- **Dinoseb**: Can affect thyroid and reproductive system; potential carcinogen.
- **Endrin**: Affects nervous system; can cause convulsions and headaches.
- **Ethylbenzene**: May cause liver, kidney, and central nervous system damage.
- **Ethylene dibromide (EDB)**: Highly toxic; affects the lungs, stomach, and reproductive system.
- **Haloacetonitriles (HAN)**: Potential carcinogens; can affect liver and kidneys.
- **1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone**: Limited data, but may be carcinogenic.
- **Heptachlor epoxide**: Liver damage and increased cancer risk.
- **Hexachlorocyclopentadiene**: Irritation to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.
- **Mercury**: Affects the nervous system, particularly in fetuses and young children.
- **Nitrate**: Can cause "blue baby syndrome" and affect oxygen transport in blood.
- **Nitrite**: Similar effects as nitrate; can affect oxygen transport in blood.
- **p-Dichlorobenzene**: Potential liver and kidney effects; data limited.
- **Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)**: Linked to cancer, liver damage, and developmental effects.
- **Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS)**: May affect cholesterol levels, liver, and thyroid.
- **Radium**: Increased risk of bone cancer; affects teeth and bones.
- **Simazine**: Endocrine disruptor; potential carcinogen.
- **Styrene**: Possible effects on the nervous system; may affect hearing and vision.
- **Tetrachloroethylene**: Neurological effects, kidney and liver damage; likely carcinogen.
- **Toluene**: Affects the nervous system; can cause kidney and liver damage.
- **1,1,1-Trichloroethane**: Central nervous system depressant; may affect liver and kidneys.
- **Trichloroethylene**: Can cause liver, kidney, and immune system damage; probable carcinogen.
- **Trihalomethanes (THMs)**: Linked to bladder and colorectal cancer; may affect liver, kidney, and central nervous system.
- **Uranium**: Kidney damage and increased risk of cancer.
- **Xylenes (total)**: Affect the central nervous system; can cause liver and kidney damage.
